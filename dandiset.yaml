description: 'Overview:

  This dataset consists of a series of NWB files, each encapsulating a comprehensive
  collection of peristimulus time histograms derived from electrophysiological recordings
  in the inferotemporal cortex of individual macaques. These recordings were specifically
  conducted during Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) tasks.

  Contents:

  Subject Representation: Each NWB file in the dataset corresponds to a single subject
  (macaque).

  Data Structure: Within each file, the dataset includes a series of peristimulus
  time histograms, which reflect the neural responses to visual stimuli.

  Recording Frequency: The frequency of recordings varies, encompassing a range from
  one to multiple recordings per day, and potentially extending to consecutive days.

  Data Consolidation: All recordings from a single subject, utilizing the same stimulus
  set, are consolidated into one NWB file.

  Stimulus Sets:

  The corresponding visual stimulus sets used in these recordings are uploaded and
  stored separately within this DANDI set.'
